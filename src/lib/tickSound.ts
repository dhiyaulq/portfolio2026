 * A soft clock "tick", synthesised once with Web Audio (no asset to download)
 * and replayed each time a card crosses the centre of the showcase.
 *
 * Browsers only let audio start after a real user gesture — click, tap or key
 * press. Scrolling with a wheel or trackpad does NOT count, so the ticks stay
 * silent until the visitor has interacted with the page once. Ticks only
 * play in the 3D layouts, and choosing one from the switcher is itself a click,
 * so in practice the sound is ready by the time it's needed.
